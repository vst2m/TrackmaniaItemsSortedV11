# Notice

This is a fork from the [original repo](https://github.com/ski-freak/TrackmaniaItemsSorted) by ski-freak so this version stays available in an [Openplanet plugin](https://github.com/vst2m/ItemManager/tree/main).

# TrackmaniaItemsSorted

The complete sorted item set of all the important custom items for trackmania mapping, most of which are from item exchange.


This includes almost all the useful route item sets as well as some scenery sets that were relatively generic. Few scenery items have been included as they are usually used for one specific map idea, so if you want them you can get more from [Item Exchange](https://item.mania.exchange) 

If you have a question or problem, there is a 99% chance it can be answered by reading everything here, but if not then you can open an issue or nag me in my [discord](https://discord.gg/sRB54zg) because I rarely check github.

# NOTE: Most of this readme is incredibly out of date, written years ago. Any information besides the instructions may or may not be correct. 

-----------------------------------

## Instructions:

1: Download the zip file of the latest release from the releases tab on the right. ([here](https://github.com/That-Ski-Freak/TrackmaniaItemsSorted/releases) is the link for those of you who do not like looking)

2: It is HIGHLY recommended to remove all files from your Documents\Trackmania\Items AND Documents\Trackmania\Blocks and back them up somewhere else on your computer. This is to avoid having duplicate items which can cause issues and frustration.

3: Put the zip file into Documents\Trackmania\Items

4: Right click on the zip file and "extract here". Make sure you are extracting to the items folder and not to a sub folder with the name of the zip folder.

5: Next time you (re)launch the game you should see the items in the item mode (f3). If they are not, you messed something up.

## Or just clone the repo to your items folder!

## Using in game, tips, and help:

Most items are in the item mode of the editor and sorted, if you look in the bottom right you can see the folder names as you hover over them. There are 10 main folders which all other folders are in:

* Juice items - Mirrors the structure of the vanilla blocks but with more/different shapes.
* Road Extentions - More road shapes and transitions between them.
* Platform Extentions - More platform shapes and transitions between them.  
* Inversions - Wallrides, quartarpipes, etc. The fullspeed blocks.
* Narrow - The narrow platform/road hybrid blocks, as well as teroor's narrow dirt and concrete items.
* Misc. - Random stuff, tm2 blocks, non vanilla effects, half blocks, etc.
* Scenery - Numbers, lights, decals for poles, extra supports, road edge lights, + some conventional scenery items.
* Checkpoints - Custom Starts, checkpoints, and finishes.


Block items however I cannot control where they go. The game places them in with the vanilla blocks in block mode (f2). **Most require you to use air mode.**

* **Magnets are in with their normal platform counterparts.**  
* Tm2 ramps are in 1-1-1-1   
* There are overhang beam versions of rings in with the other rings at 12-2-1/2   
* Stadium ground transitions are in 13-1-2-3-5/6. The grass remover is located in the same folder at 13-1-2-3-5-2 (you have to click the arrow to see it).

--------------------------------------

## Random Info

Trackmania sorts the items in the item folder by reverse alphabetical order. That is why many folders have random letters or numbers preceding them, to force a spesific order.

Known issue: Game doesn't load. The cause is having too many objects, tm is limited to 25k ish and this counts nadeo blocks, items, macros, and club items. If it doesn't load try removing all club items and old item folders and see if it works.


Here are some sets excluded for either cluttering up the editor or being nearly pointless imo, but you may consider downloading yourself and adding them to the USER_ITEMS_HERE folder:  
* [Icy campaign items](https://item.exchange/set/view/11164)  
* [Dirt road conversion](https://item.exchange/set/view/11244)  
* [Grass road conversion](https://item.exchange/set/view/11261)  
* [Plastic road borders](https://item.mania.exchange/set/view/11220)  
* [The winter 2021 tmgl items](https://item.exchange/set/view/10616)  
* [Some gps items](https://item.exchange/set/view/10883)

### FAQ:  

Q: "Why are the magnets in with the blocks I couldn't find them >:("  
A: The magnets most people used for a long time were created shortly after the game's release and were not well optimized. Doomsday made improved magnets with less file size and a much better experience when using freemode since they are blocks rather than items.  

Q: "Why is Y item(s) not included?"  
A: Either I didn't know it existed (unlikely), they were released recently and I haven't updated yet, they are scenery, or the items were so poorly made I excluded them for that reason.  

Q: "Why is X broken ReallyMad"  
A: Becuase you didn't follow the instructions.
